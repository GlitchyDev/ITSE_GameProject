# ITSE_GameProject

Hello!

As part of our final project for our Intro to Software Engineering class, we are required to make a big collaborative software project!
We decided to have fun with it and build a video game, a 2D infinitely generating multiplayer Dungeon Crawler! Wooo! Much fun!

Here is our Team!

Robert: Framework developer

Charlie: Head of terrain and structure generation and cat herder

Tanner: Founder of the git and contributor of great ideas!

Abdullah: SQLer

Ben: Sound designer
